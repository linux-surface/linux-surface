Subject: [PATCH] Input: soc_button_array - support AMD variant Surface devices

The power button on the AMD variant of the Surface Laptop uses the
same MSHW0040 device ID as the 5th and later generation of Surface
devices, however they report 0 for their OEM platform revision.  As the
_DSM does not exist on the devices requiring special casing, check for
the existance of the _DSM to determine if soc_button_array should be
loaded.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: surfacepro3_button: don't load on amd
 variant

The AMD variant of the Surface Laptop report 0 for their OEM platform
revision.  The Surface devices that require the surfacepro3_button
driver do not have the _DSM that gets the OEM platform revision.  If the
method does not exist, load surfacepro3_button.
