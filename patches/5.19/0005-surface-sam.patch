Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator: Allow is_ssam_device() to be
 used when CONFIG_SURFACE_AGGREGATOR_BUS is disabled

In SSAM subsystem drivers that handle both ACPI and SSAM-native client
devices, we may want to check whether we have a SSAM (native) client
device. Further, we may want to do this even when instantiation thereof
cannot happen due to CONFIG_SURFACE_AGGREGATOR_BUS=n. Currently, doing
so causes an error due to an undefined reference error due to
ssam_device_type being placed in the bus source unit.

Therefore, if CONFIG_SURFACE_AGGREGATOR_BUS is not defined, simply let
is_ssam_device() return false to prevent this error.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator: Allow devices to be marked as
 hot-removed

Some SSAM devices, notably the keyboard cover (keyboard and touchpad) on
the Surface Pro 8, can be hot-removed. When this occurs, communication
with the device may fail and time out. This timeout can unnecessarily
block and slow down device removal and even cause issues when the
devices are detached and re-attached quickly. Thus, communication should
generally be avoided once hot-removal is detected.

While we already remove a device as soon as we detect its (hot-)removal,
the corresponding device driver may still attempt to communicate with
the device during teardown. This is especially critical as communication
failure may also extend to disabling of events, which is typically done
at that stage.

Add a flag to allow marking devices as hot-removed. This can then be
used during client driver teardown to check if any communication
attempts should be avoided.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator: Allow notifiers to avoid
 communication on unregistering

When SSAM client devices have been (physically) hot-removed,
communication attempts with those devices may fail and time out. This
can even extend to event notifiers, due to which timeouts may occur
during device removal, slowing down that process.

Add a parameter to the notifier unregister function that allows skipping
communication with the EC to prevent this. Furthermore, add wrappers for
registering and unregistering notifiers belonging to SSAM client devices
that automatically check if the device has been marked as hot-removed
and communication should be avoided.

Note that non-SSAM client devices can generally not be hot-removed, so
also add a convenience wrapper for those, defaulting to allow
communication.

Subject: [PATCH] HID: surface-hid: Add support for hot-removal

Add support for hot-removal of SSAM HID client devices.

Once a device has been hot-removed, further communication with it should
be avoided as it may fail and time out. While the device will be removed
as soon as we detect hot-removal, communication may still occur during
teardown, especially when unregistering notifiers.

While hot-removal is a surprise event that can happen at any time, try
to avoid communication as much as possible once it has been detected to
prevent timeouts that can slow down device removal and cause issues,
e.g. when quickly re-attaching the device.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator: Add comment for KIP subsystem
 category

The KIP subsystem (full name unknown, abbreviation has been obtained
through reverse engineering) handles detachable peripherals such as the
keyboard cover on the Surface Pro X and Surface Pro 8.

It is currently not entirely clear what this subsystem entails, but at
the very least it provides event notifications for when the keyboard
cover on the Surface Pro X and Surface Pro 8 have been detached or
re-attached, as well as the state that the keyboard cover is currently
in (e.g. folded-back, folded laptop-like, closed, etc.).

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator_registry: Generify subsystem hub
 functionality

The Surface System Aggregator Module (SSAM) has multiple subsystems that
can manage detachable devices. At the moment, we only support the "base"
(BAS/0x11) subsystem, which is used on the Surface Book 3 to manage
devices (including keyboard, touchpad, and secondary battery) connected
to the base of the device.

The Surface Pro 8 has a new type-cover with keyboard and touchpad, which
is managed via the KIP/0x0e subsystem. The general procedure is the
same, but with slightly different events and setup. To make
implementation of the KIP hub easier and prevent duplication, generify
the parts of the base hub that we can use for the KIP hub (or any
potential future subsystem hubs).

This also switches over to use the newly introduced "hot-remove"
functionality, which should prevent communication issues when devices
have been detached.

Lastly, also drop the undocumented and unused sysfs "state" attribute of
the base hub. It has at best been useful for debugging.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator_registry: Change device ID for
 base hub

Use the target category of the (base) hub as instance id in the
(virtual) hub device UID. This makes association of the hub with the
respective subsystem easier.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator_registry: Add KIP device hub

Add a Surface System Aggregator Module (SSAM) client device hub for
hot-removable devices managed via the KIP subsystem.

The KIP subsystem (full name unknown, abbreviation has been obtained
through reverse engineering) is a subsystem that manages hot-removable
SSAM client devices. Specifically, it manages HID input devices
contained in the detachable keyboard cover of the Surface Pro 8 and
Surface Pro X.

The KIP subsystem handles a single group of devices (e.g. all devices
contained in the keyboard cover) and cannot handle devices individually.
Thus we model it as a client device hub, which (hot-)removes all devices
contained under it once removal of the hub (e.g. keyboard cover) has
been detected and (re-)adds all devices once the physical hub device has
been (re-)attached. To do this, use the previously generified SSAM
subsystem hub framework.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator_registry: Add support for
 keyboard cover on Surface Pro 8

Add support for the detachable keyboard cover on the Surface Pro 8.

The keyboard cover on the Surface Pro 8 is, unlike the keyboard covers
of earlier Surface Pro generations, handled via the Surface System
Aggregator Module (SSAM). The keyboard and touchpad (as well as other
HID input devices) of this cover are standard SSAM HID client devices
(just like keyboard and touchpad on e.g. the Surface Laptop 3 and 4),
however, some care needs to be taken as they can be physically detached
(similarly to the Surface Book 3). Specifically, the respective SSAM
client devices need to be removed when the keyboard cover has been
detached and (re-)initialized when the keyboard cover has been
(re-)attached.

On the Surface Pro 8, detachment of the keyboard cover (and by extension
its devices) is managed via the KIP subsystem. Therefore, said devices
need to be registered under the KIP device hub, which in turn will
remove and re-create/re-initialize those devices as needed.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: Add KIP/POS tablet-mode switch driver
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add a driver providing a tablet-mode switch input device for Microsoft
Surface devices using the Surface Aggregator KIP subsystem (to manage
detachable peripherals) or POS subsystem (to obtain device posture
information).

The KIP (full name unknown, abbreviation found through reverse
engineering) subsystem is used on the Surface Pro 8 and Surface Pro X to
manage the keyboard cover. Among other things, it provides information
on the positioning (posture) of the cover (closed, laptop-style,
detached, folded-back, ...), which can be used to implement an input
device providing the SW_TABLET_MODE event. Similarly, the POS (posture
information) subsystem provides such information on the Surface Laptop
Studio, with the difference being that the keyboard is not detachable.

As implementing the tablet-mode switch for both subsystems is largely
similar, the driver proposed in this commit, in large, acts as a generic
tablet mode switch driver framework for the Surface Aggregator Module.
Specific implementations using this framework are provided for the KIP
and POS subsystems, adding tablet-mode switch support to the
aforementioned devices.

A few more notes on the Surface Laptop Studio:

A peculiarity of the Surface Laptop Studio is its "slate/tent" mode
(symbolized: user> _/\). In this mode, the screen covers the keyboard
but leaves the touchpad exposed. This is essentially a mode in-between
tablet and laptop, and it is debatable whether tablet-mode should be
enabled in this mode. We therefore let the user decide this via a module
parameter.

In particular, tablet-mode may bring up the on-screen touch keyboard
more easily, which would be desirable in this mode. However, some
user-space software currently also decides to disable keyboard and, more
importantly, touchpad input, while the touchpad is still accessible in
the "slate/tent" mode. Furthermore, this mode shares its identifier with
"slate/flipped" mode where the screen is flipped 180° and the keyboard
points away from the user (symbolized: user> /_). In this mode we would
like to enable auto-rotation, something that user-space software may
only do when tablet-mode is enabled. We therefore default to the
slate-mode enabling the tablet-mode switch.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator_registry: Add support for tablet
 mode switch on Surface Pro 8

Add a KIP subsystem tablet-mode switch device for the Surface Pro 8.
The respective driver for this device provides SW_TABLET_MODE input
events for user-space based on the state of the keyboard cover (e.g.
detached, folded-back, normal/laptop mode).

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator: Move device registry helper
 functions to core module

Move helper functions for client device registration to the core module.
This simplifies addition of future DT/OF support and also allows us to
split out the device hub drivers into their own module.

At the same time, also improve device node validation a bit by not
silently skipping devices with invalid device UID specifiers. Further,
ensure proper lifetime management for the firmware/software nodes
associated with the added devices.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator: Move subsystem hub drivers to
 their own module

Split out subsystem device hub drivers into their own module. This
allows us to load the hub drivers separately from the registry, which
will help future DT/OF support.

While doing so, also remove a small bit of code duplication.

Subject: [PATCH] MAINTAINERS: repair file entry in MICROSOFT SURFACE
 AGGREGATOR TABLET-MODE SWITCH

Commit 9f794056db5b ("platform/surface: Add KIP/POS tablet-mode switch
driver") adds the section MICROSOFT SURFACE AGGREGATOR TABLET-MODE SWITCH
with a file entry, but the file that is added with this commit is actually
named slightly differently.

  file entry name: drivers/platform/surface/surface_aggregator_tablet_switch.c
  added file name: drivers/platform/surface/surface_aggregator_tabletsw.c

Hence, ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --self-test=patterns complains about a
broken reference.

Repair this file entry to the actual file name added with the commit above.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator_registry: Rename HID device
 nodes based on new findings

On Windows, the HID devices with target ID 1 are grouped as "Surface Hot
Plug - SAM". Rename their device nodes in the registry to reflect that
and update the comments accordingly.

Subject: [PATCH] platform/surface: aggregator_registry: Add HID devices for
 sensors and UCSI client to SP8

Add software nodes for the HID sensor collection and the UCM UCSI HID
client to the Surface Pro 8. In contrast to the type-cover devices,
these devices are directly attached to the SAM controller, without any
hub.

This enables support for HID-based sensors, including the ones used for
automatic screen rotation, on the Surface Pro 8.
