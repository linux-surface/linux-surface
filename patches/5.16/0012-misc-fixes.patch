Subject: [PATCH] acpi/battery: Add device HID and quirk for Microsoft Surface
 Go 3

For some reason, the Microsoft Surface Go 3 uses the standard ACPI
interface for battery information, but does not use the standard PNP0C0A
HID. Instead it uses MSHW0146 as identifier. Add that ID to the driver
as this seems to work well.

Additionally, the power state is not updated immediately after the AC
has been (un-)plugged, so add the respective quirk for that.

Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: battery: Add "Not Charging" quirk for Microsoft Surface
 devices

Microsoft Surface devices have a limiter that sets a fixed maximum
charge capacity for the battery. When that maximum capacity has been
reached, charging stops. In that case, _BST returns a battery state
field with both "charging" and "discharging" bits cleared. The battery
driver, however, returns "unknown" as status.

This seems to be the same behavior as observed on the ThinkPads, so
let's use the same quirk to handle that as well.

For what it's worth, I don't think the ACPI spec explicitly states that
any of the status bits need to be set, or that there are only the
"charging" and "discharging" states. As far as I can tell, ACPI only
states:

    Notice that the Charging bit and the Discharging bit are mutually
    exclusive and must not both be set at the same time. Even in
    critical state, hardware should report the corresponding
    charging/discharging state.

But that does not exclude the case that no bit is set. So, strictly
going by spec, I don't think it's necessary to put all of this behind a
quirk.

Subject: [PATCH] surface: surface3_power: Fix battery readings on batteries
 without a serial number

The battery on the 2nd hand Surface 3 which I recently bought appears to
not have a serial number programmed in. This results in any I2C reads from
the registers containing the serial number failing with an I2C NACK.

This was causing mshw0011_bix() to fail causing the battery readings to
not work at all.

Ignore EREMOTEIO (I2C NACK) errors when retrieving the serial number and
continue with an empty serial number to fix this.
